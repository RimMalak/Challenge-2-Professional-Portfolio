# Challenge-2-Professional-Portfolio
Professional Portfolio is my first website.
I experimented with links and anchors, animations and Pseudo-Classes.
I used Flexbox to structure my page, and the Grid to display my work. The final layout is very clean. Finally I gave the website a responsive design by using Media queries.
